# String-Matching-with-Dynamic-Programming
### DNA Matching

**Abstract**
In this project you will implement and compare two algorithms that solve the same problem. The first is an exhaustive algorithm with a slow (i.e. exponential) running time, while the second is a dynamic programming algorithm with a fast (i.e. polynomial) running time.
Both algorithms solve the problem of finding the longest common subsequence of two strings. More specifically, given two strings, the algorithm finds the length of the longest sequence of characters (in order) that match between the two strings.

From word correction to DNA fragment matching. Within the general category of string matching are many different problems. A subsequence of a string is a set of characters from a string that are in the same order as they were in the original. For example: ACEF is a subsequence ABCDEFGH. A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that can be constructed from both strings. For example: ACEF is a common subsequence ABCDEFGH and XACYEF. Therefore the longest common subsequence is the longest such common subsequence that can be found from the two strings.
